The mother of a student who was stabbed to death in a knife rampage in Nottingham accused the police of having “blood on your hands” for failing to prevent the attack, as the killer was sentenced to a hospital order. Valdo Calocane, 32, killed Nottingham University students Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, both 19, and a school caretaker, Ian Coates, 65, on June 13 last year. Speaking outside the court, Emma Webber, the mother of Barnaby, accused the Crown Prosecution Service of not consulting with families over bringing manslaughter charges instead of murder charges.
